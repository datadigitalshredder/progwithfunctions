Significant Program Proposal

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
Analysis of Covid-19 tests patterns for Chicago residents, 2020 to 2021.
2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve?
Analysis of this data will give information on the trends and patterns of Covid-19 testing in a specified community and will help educate decision makers on policy implementation.
3. What will you learn from developing this program?
I will be able to summarize and visualize raw and complex data and draw conclusions from it.
4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.)
I’m planning on using csv, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and pytest.
5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?
Yes, the entire program will be separated into functions.
6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions?
Yes, all functions will be tested using test functions.
